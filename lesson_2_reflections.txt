What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	It creates an empty git repository on branch master with several files waiting to be tracked. Because only after adding the files we can track the changes.git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is a buffer for changes to be committed, which working repository is the changed repositorygit. It can be used to separate commits logically.
