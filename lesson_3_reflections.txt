When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I would like to collaborate with others, use multiple computers to work or simply keep a safe copy on somewhere else.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Sometimes the remote repository and the local one differ because we just want to do some experiments locally without getting the newest version.
