When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I would like to collaborate with others, use multiple computers to work or simply keep a safe copy on somewhere else.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Sometimes the remote repository and the local one differ because we just want to do some experiments locally without getting the newest version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are clone operations performed by GitHub, which record additional information about where this forked repository comes from. Branches are just different commits, they are in the same place.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	We can update that remote separately to get knowledge of where the repository goes and if there is divergence, we can merge these two to resolve the differences.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Make some changes and copy the files from other people to manually check the difference and see if it will work. If it works perfectly, I just copy the file in. Using Git and GitHub, we will need create extra merge commits.
